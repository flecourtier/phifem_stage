= Introduction

This end of study internship is a 2nd year internship in the CSMI Master ("Calcul Scientifique et Math√©matique de l'Information") of the University of Strasbourg. It is the continuation of a project done during the first semester of M2, the main objective of this project was the discovery of an innovative non-conformal finite element method for augmented surgery, the stem:[\phi]-FEM method. The purpose of this project was to have Cemosis and Mimesis collaborate through the use of Feel++ software (developed by Cemosis) in the framework of the stem:[\phi]-FEM method (one of the research topics of the Mimesis team).

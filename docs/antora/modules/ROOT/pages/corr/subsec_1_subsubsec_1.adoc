= Correction by multiplying

In this second method, we try to approach the exact solution in a different way. In fact, we want to bring the factor between the stem:[tilde{\phi}] solution and the solution of the corrected problem closer to 1. In other words, by considering 
[stem]
++++
\tilde{u}=\tilde{\phi}C,
++++
we try to bring stem:[C=\frac{\tilde{u}}{\tilde{\phi}}] closer to 1 (for stem:[\tilde{\phi}\ne 0]). This type of correction is called correction by multiplying.

So we're looking for stem:[C: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d] solution to the problem
[stem]
++++
\label{eq.corr.pbc_mult}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
&-\Delta (\tilde{\phi}C)=f \quad &&\Omega \\
&C=1 \quad &&\Gamma
\end{aligned}\right. \tag{stem:[\mathcal{C}_\times]}
++++


[NOTE]
====
In the same way as for correction by adding, we note that this problem is equivalent to the initial #add ref# problem.

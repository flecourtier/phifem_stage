= Presentation of different problems considered

In this section, we present the different problems we will be considering in xref:corr/subsec_3.adoc[Section "Numerical results"]. We will consider the geometry of a circle in xref:corr/subsec_0_subsubsec_0.adoc[Section "First domain : the Circle."] represented in <<geom_circle>> as well as the geometry of a square in xref:corr/subsec_0_subsubsec_1.adoc[Section "Second domain : the Square."] represented in <<geom_square>>. For the circle, we will consider a first analytic trigonometric solution, parameterized in such a way that the problem can be considered homogeneous. we will then consider a second problem for which no exact solution is known, and for which we will take an over-refined FEM solution as the reference solution. For the square, we will consider only an analytic trigonometric solution parameterized in such a way that the problem can be considered homogeneous.

[NOTE]
====
To generate meshes with FEM, we will consider a mesh comparable to stem:[\phi]-FEM. To do this, we generate our stem:[\phi]-FEM grid, which is simply the regular mesh of the stem:[\mathcal{O}] domain of stem:[n_{vert}\times n_{vert}] nodes. From this mesh we generate a FEM mesh whose largest element diameter stem:[h_{FEM}] is very close to the largest diameter associated with stem:[\phi-FEM], stem:[h_{\phi-FEM}] (stem:[h_{FEM}\sim h_{\phi-FEM}]). Here, we have a representation of the meshes generated for FEM and stem:[\phi]-FEM on the circle (<<mesh_circle>>) and on the square (<<mesh_square>>) with stem:[n_{vert}=10] vertices in each direction.

[NOTE]

Note that in the case where the problem is non-homogeneous, if we don't have a definition of the Dirichlet boundary condition, we can consider

g(x,y)=u_{ex}(x,y)\times(1+\phi(x,y))

with stem:[\phi] the level-set function, null by definition on stem:[\Gamma].

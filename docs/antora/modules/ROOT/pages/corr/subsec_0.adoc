= Presentation of different problems considered

#A faire au fur et à mesure !#

In this section, we present the different problems we'll be considering in xref:corr/subsec_2.adoc[Section "Different correction results"]. We will consider the geometry of a circle in xref:corr/subsec_0_subsubsec_0.adoc[Section "First domain : the Circle."] represented in <<geom_circle>> as well as the geometry of a square in xref:corr/subsec_0_subsubsec_1.adoc[Section "Second domain : the Square."] represented in <<geom_square>>. We'll also look at different solutions #à compléter (sol analytique-exacte vs sol de référence calculés avec FEM sur-raffinée)#.

[NOTE]
====
Note that in the case where the problem is non-homogeneous, we can consider
[stem]
++++
g(x,y)=u_{ex}(x,y)\times(1+\phi(x,y))
++++
with stem:[\phi] the levelset function, null by definition on stem:[\Gamma].

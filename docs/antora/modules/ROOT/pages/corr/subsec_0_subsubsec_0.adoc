= First domain : the Circle.

Here, we will consider the stem:[\Omega] domain to be the circle of radius stem:[\sqrt{2}/4] and center stem:[(0.5,0.5)].This domain is entirely included in the fictitious domain stem:[O=[0,1]^2] (<<geom_circle>>).

We will consider the level-set function stem:[\phi] defined by
[stem]
++++
\phi(x,y)=-1/8+(x-1/2)^2+(y-1/2)^2,
++++
negative function inside the domain, null at the boundary and positive outside it

We will consider a first analytic trigonometric solution (<<_first_problem>>), parameterized in such a way that the problem can be considered homogeneous and then consider a second problem (<<_second_problem>>) for which no exact solution is known, and for which we'll take an over-refined FEM solution as the reference solution.

== First problem

Here, we are interested in the Poisson problem with an analytical solution
[stem]
++++
u_{ex}(x,y)=S\times\sin\left(8\pi f\left((x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2\right)+\varphi\right)
++++
where stem:[S\in[0,1]] is the amplitude of the signal, stem:[f\in\mathbb{N}] can be associated with the "frequency" of the signal and stem:[\varphi\in[0,1]] the phase at the origin, represented in <<sol_circle>>.

Thus, the second associated member is defined by
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
f(x,y)=256\pi^2 S f^2&\left((x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2\right)\sin\left[8\pi f\left((x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2\right) + \varphi\right] \\
&- 32\pi S f\cos\left[8\pi f \left((x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2\right) + \varphi\right]
\end{aligned}
++++
and represented in <<f_circle>>.


[NOTE]
====
Note that for stem:[\varphi=0], the Dirichlet conditions considered are then homogeneous on the circle (i.e. stem:[g=0] on stem:[\Gamma]).

== Second problem

In the case considered here, no analytical solution is known. We consider the source term stem:[f] to be a Gaussian defined by
[stem]
++++
f(x,y) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_0)^2 + (y-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\,,
++++
with stem:[\sigma \sim \mathcal{U}([0.1,0.6])] and stem:[\mu_0, \mu_1 \sim \mathcal{U}([0.5-\sqrt{2}/4, 0.5+\sqrt{2}/4])] with the condition stem:[\phi(\mu_0, \mu_1) < -0.05] and represented in <<f_circle_gaussian>>

Since we don't have an exact solution, we will consider a so-called reference solution, denoted stem:[u_{ref}]. This reference solution is defined as an over-refined stem:[\mathbb{P}^1] solution obtained by the standard FEM method (with stem:[h_{ref}\approx 0.006]). It is to this reference solution that we can compare the solutions obtained by the correction methods or by the FNO.


[NOTE]
====
For this problem, we choose to consider only the homogeneous case, i.e. we take stem:[g=0] on stem:[\Gamma].

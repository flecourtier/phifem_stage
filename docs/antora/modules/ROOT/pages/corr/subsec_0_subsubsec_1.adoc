= Second domain : the Square.

Here, we'll consider the stem:[\Omega] domain to be the unit square stem:[\Omega=[0,1]^2]. This domain is entirely included in the fictitious domain stem:[O=[-0.5,1.5]^2] (<<geom_square>>).

In this case, we'll consider two levelset functions. The first function stem:[\phi], defined by
[stem]
++++
\phi(x,y)=x(1-x)y(1-y),
++++
will be used when solving the weak problem. However, it cannot be used to construct our cell and face sets, as it is only negative within the stem:[\Omega] domain (<<levelset_square>>).

To construct the sets of cells and faces needed to perform the stem:[\phi]-FEM method, we will consider a second function, denoted stem:[\phi_C] and defined by
[stem]
++++
\phi_C(x,y)=\max(|x-0.5|,|y-0.5|)-0.5,
++++
which is indeed negative inside the domain, zero at the boundary and positive outside, but which does not sufficiently satisfy the regularity conditions necessary for stem:[\phi]-FEM.

We the considered different problems #à compléter#.

== First problem

Here, we are interested in the Poisson problem with as analytical solution
[stem]
++++
u_{ex}(x,y)=S\times\sin\left(2\pi fx+\varphi\right)\times\sin\left(2\pi fy+\varphi\right)
++++
where stem:[S\in[0,1]] is the amplitude of the signal, stem:[f\in\mathbb{N}] can be associated with the "frequency" of the signal and stem:[\varphi\in[0,1]] the phase at the origin.

Thus, the associated second member is defined by
[stem]
++++
f(x,y)=8\pi^2 Sf^2\sin\left(2\pi fx + \varphi\right)\sin\left(2\pi fy + \varphi\right)
++++


[NOTE]
====
It should be noted that as for the circle for stem:[\varphi=0], the Dirichlet conditions considered are then homogeneous on the square (i.e. stem:[g=0] on stem:[\Gamma]).

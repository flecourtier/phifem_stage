= Correction by adding

In this first method, we will try to approximate the solution obtained stem:[\tilde{\phi}] to the exact solution by completing the difference between the two, which is what we will call correction by adding. To do this, we will consider
[stem]
++++
\tilde{u}=\tilde{\phi}+\tilde{C}
++++
and we want to find stem:[\tilde{C}: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d] solution to the problem
[stem]
++++
\left\{\begin{aligned}
-\Delta \tilde{u}&=f, \; &&\text{on } \Omega, \\
\tilde{u}&=g, \; &&\text{in } \Gamma.
\end{aligned}\right.
++++

[NOTE]
====
Note that this problem is in fact equivalent to the initial #add ref# problem. We only hope that the approximate solution stem:[\tilde{u}] obtained is more accurate than the approximate solution stem:[u] obtained by solving the initial problem.

Rewriting the problem, we seek to find stem:[\tilde{C}: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d] solution to the problem

\label{eq.corr.pbc_add}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
-\Delta \tilde{C}&=\tilde{f}, \; &&\text{on } \Omega, \\
\tilde{C}&=0, \; &&\text{in } \Gamma.
\end{aligned}\right. \tag{stem:[\mathcal{C}_{+}]}

with stem:[\tilde{f}=f+\Delta\tilde{\phi}].

Thus for the standard FEM method, the weak formulation will be given by
[stem]
++++
\int_\Omega \nabla\tilde{C}\cdot\nabla v=\int_\Omega \tilde{f}v
++++
where the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions can be strongly imposed by classical methods (penalization, elimination...).

For the stem:[\phi]-FEM method, we look for stem:[C] such that stem:[\tilde{C}=\phi C] and the weak formulation (associated with a homogeneous problem because stem:[\tilde{C}=0] on stem:[\Gamma]) is given by
[stem]
++++
\int_{\Omega_h} \nabla (\phi C) \cdot \nabla (\phi v) - \int_{\partial\Omega_h} \frac{\partial}{\partial n}(\phi C)\phi v+G_h(w,v)=\int_{\Omega_h} \tilde{f} \phi v + G_h^{rhs}(v)
++++
with
[stem]
++++
G_h(C,v)=\sigma h\sum_{E\in\mathcal{F}_h^\Gamma} \int_E \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial n}(\phi C)\right] \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial n}(\phi v)\right]+\sigma h^2\sum_{T\in\mathcal{T}_h^\Gamma} \int_{T} \Delta(\phi C)\Delta(\phi v)
++++
and
[stem]
++++
G_h^{rhs}(v)=-\sigma h^2\sum_{T\in\mathcal{T}_h^\Gamma} \int_{T} \tilde{f} \Delta(\phi v).
++++


[NOTE]
====
In practice, it may be useful to integrate by parts (IPP) the term containing stem:[\Delta \tilde{\phi}] (implicitly included in stem:[\tilde{f}]). #expliciter !#

= Deliverables

In the context of the internship, the following deliverables are provided:


*  a https://github.com/flecourtier/phifem_stage/blob/main/docs/suivi/suivi.pdf[weekly tracking report], written in French, was produced as the internship progressed, listing the objectives and results for each week.
*  a https://github.com/flecourtier/phifem_stage[github repository] containing all the code allowing to reproduce the results presented in this report, as well as the documents written during the internship. The codes have been implemented in Python: for the finite element solvers, we'll be using the FEniCS library, and for the neural network implementation, we'll be using Tensorflow and Pytorch.
*  an https://flecourtier.github.io/phifem_stage/phifem_project/1.0.3/main_page.html[online report] generated with a tool called antora\footnote{Antora : \url{https://antora.org/}}. A continuous integration has been set up on github to execute a python code for each new push, enabling the latex file to be converted directly into this antora documentation.

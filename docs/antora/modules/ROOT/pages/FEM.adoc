In the following, we will consider the Poisson problem with Dirichlet condition (homogeneous or non-homogeneous):

*Problem :* Find stem:[u : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d] such that

\left\{
\begin{aligned}
-\Delta u &= f, \; &&\text{in } \; \Omega, \\
u&=g, \; &&\text{on } \; \partial\Omega,
\end{aligned}
\right.

with stem:[\Delta] the Laplace operator and stem:[\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d] a lipschitzian bounded open set (and stem:[\partial\Omega] its boundary).

Here, we present the 2 finite element methods we will be considering. First, we will present the standard FEM method in xref:FEM/subsec_0.adoc[Section "Standard FEM"], followed by the stem:[\phi]-FEM method in xref:FEM/subsec_1.adoc[Section "stem:[\phi]-FEM"].

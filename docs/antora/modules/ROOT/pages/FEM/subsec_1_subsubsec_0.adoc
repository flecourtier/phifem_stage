= Context and general principle of the method

The PhiFEM method is a new fictitious domain finite element method that does not require a mesh conforming to the real boundary. In the context of augmented surgery, this method presents a considerable advantage. During real-time simulation, the geometry (in our specific context, an organ such as the liver, for example) can deform over time. Methods such as standard FEM, which requires a mesh fitted to the boundary, necessitate a complete remeshing of the geometry at each time step (<<mesh_fem>>). Unlike this type of method, stem:[\phi]-FEM requires only the generation of a single mesh : the mesh of a fictitious domain containing the entire geometry (<<mesh_phifem>>). As the boundary of the geometry is represented by a level-set function stem:[\phi], only this function will change over time, which is a real time-saver.


[NOTE]
====
Note that changing the stem:[\phi] function creates new sets of cells, all of them described in the <<_description_of_spaces>>.

[NOTE]
====
For the purposes of this internship, the geometries considered are not organs (such as the liver), because these are complex geometries. We are considering simpler geometries such as circles or squares. It is also important to note that the stem:[\phi]-FEM method has a considerable advantage: by constructing a fictitious mesh around the domain, we can generate a Cartesian mesh. This type of mesh can easily be represented by matrices, in the same way as images, hence the possibility of teaching these stem:[\phi]-FEM solutions to an FNO who generally works on images. A paper in progress presents results with the combination of PhiFEM and an FNO on more complex geometries, notably ellipses.

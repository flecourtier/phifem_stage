= Fictitious domain methods

The method we are interested in, called the stem:[\phi]-FEM method, is a fictitious domain method, i.e. it does not require a mesh conforming to the real boundary. In the context of augmented surgery, fictitious domain methods presents a considerable advantage in comparison to standard FEM approaches. During real-time simulation, the geometry (in our specific context, an organ such as the liver, for example) can deform over time. Methods such as standard FEM, which requires a mesh fitted to the boundary, necessitate a complete remeshing of the geometry at each time step (<<mesh_fem>>). Unlike this type of method, fictitious domain methods requires only the generation of a single mesh : the mesh of a fictitious domain containing the entire geometry (<<mesh_phifem>>).

*Application to the stem:[\phi]-FEM method :*

In the case of the stem:[\phi]-FEM Method, as the boundary of the geometry is represented by a level-set function stem:[\phi], only this function will change over time, which is a real time-saver.

For the purposes of this internship, the geometries considered are not organs (such as the liver), because these are complex geometries. We are considering simpler geometries such as circles or squares. 

It is also important to note that the stem:[\phi]-FEM method has a considerable advantage: by constructing a fictitious mesh around the domain, we can generate a Cartesian mesh. This type of mesh can easily be represented by matrices, in the same way as images, hence the possibility of teaching these stem:[\phi]-FEM solutions to an FNO who generally works on images. A paper in progress presents results with the combination of stem:[\phi]-FEM and an FNO on more complex geometries, notably ellipses.

= stem:[\phi]-FEM

In this section, we will present the stem:[\phi]-FEM method. We will first present the context in which the method is used and its general principle, then go into a little more detail about the method in the case of the Poisson problem with Dirichlet condition. #Finally, we will present the main numerical results of the reference article ?#

#Mettre quelques parts les trucs de géométries cartésiennes ! Utile pour FNO !#

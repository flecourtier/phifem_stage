= stem:[\phi]-FEM

In this section, we will present the stem:[\phi]-FEM method. We will first present the context in which the method is used and its general principle (xref:FEM/subsec_1_subsubsec_0.adoc[Section "Context and general principle of the method"]. Next, we will give a general presentation of the method, starting with a description of the spaces required (<<_description_of_spaces>>), followed by a description of the stem:[\phi]-FEM method (<<_description_of_the_stem:[\phi]-fem_method>>). Finally, we will give some details on the stem:[\phi]-FEM method (section \ref{FEMs.PhiFEM.details}).

= Architecture of the FNO

The following figure (<<FNO_schema>>) describes the FNO architecture in detail:

[[FNO_schema]]

The architecture of the FNO is as follows:

[stem]
++++
G_\theta = Q \circ \mathcal{H}_\theta^L \circ \dots \circ \mathcal{H}_\theta^1 \circ P
++++


We'll now describe the composition of the <<FNO_schema>> in a little more detail :

*  We start with input X of shape (batch_size, height, width, nb_channels) with batch_size the number of images to be processed at the same time, height and width the dimensions of the images and nb_channels the number of channels. Simplify by (bs,ni,nj,nk).
*  We perform a stem:[P] transformation in order to move to a space with more channels. This step enables the network to build a sufficiently rich representation of the data.  For example, a Dense layer (also known as fully-connected) can be used. 	
*  We then apply stem:[L] Fourier layers, noted stem:[\mathcal{H}_\theta^l,\; l=1,\dots,L], whose specifications will be detailed in xref:fourier/subsec_1.adoc[Section "Fourier Layer structure"].
*  We then return to the target dimension by performing a stem:[Q] transformation. In our case, the number of output channels is 1.
*  We then obtain the output of the stem:[Y] model of shape (bs,ni,nj,1).

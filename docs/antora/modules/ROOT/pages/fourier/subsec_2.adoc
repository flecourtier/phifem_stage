= Some details on the convolution sublayer

In this section, we will specify some details for the convolution layer.

== Border issues

Let stem:[W=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\hat{W})], we have :
[stem]
++++
\mathcal{C}_\theta^l(\tilde{X})=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{F}(X)\cdot\hat{W}\right)=\tilde{X}\star W
++++
with
[stem]
++++
(\tilde{X}\star W)_{ij}=\sum_{i'j'}\tilde{X}_{i-i'[ni],j-j'[nj]}W_{i'j'}
++++

In other words, multiplying in Fourier space is equivalent to performing a stem:[\star] circular convolution in real space. But these modulo operations are only natural for periodic images, which is not our case. #A compl√©ter (expliquer padding par ex)#

== FFT

To speed up computations, we will use the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The FFT is a fast algorithm to compute the DFT. It is recursive : The transformation of a signal of size stem:[N] is make from the decomposition of two sub-signals of size stem:[N/2]. The complexity of the FFT is stem:[N\log(N)] whereas the natural algorithm, which is a matrix multiplication, has a complexity of stem:[N^2].

== Real DFT

In reality, we'll be using a specific implementation of FFT, called RFFT (Real Fast Fourier Transorm).In fact, for stem:[\mathcal{F}^{-1}(A)] to be real if stem:[A] is a complex-valued matrix, it is necessary that A respects the Hermitian symmetry:
[stem]
++++
A_{i,nj-(j+1)} = \bar{A}_{i,j}
++++

In our case, we want stem:[\mathcal{C}_\theta^l(X)] to be a real image, so stem:[\mathcal{F}(X)\cdot\hat{W}] must verify Hermitian-symmetry.

To do this, we only need to collect half of the Discrete Fourier Coefficients (DFC) and the other half will be deduced by Hermitian symmetry. More precisely, using the specific RFFT implementation, the DFCs are stored in a matrix of size stem:[(ni,nj//2+1)]. Multiplication can then be performed by the stem:[\hat{W}] kernel, and when the inverse RFFT is performed, the DFCs will be automatically symmetrized. So the Hermitian symmetry of stem:[\mathcal{F}(X)\cdot\hat{W}] is verified and stem:[\mathcal{C}_\theta^l(X)] is indeed a real image.

To simplify, let's assume nk=1. Here is a diagram describing this idea:

== Low pass filter

When we perform a DFT on an image, the DFCs related to high frequencies are in practice very low. This is why we can easily filter an image by ignoring these high frequencies, i.e. by truncating the high Fourier modes. In fact, eliminating the higher Fourier modes enables a kind of regularization that helps the generalization. So, in practice, it's sufficient to keep only the DFCs corresponding to low frequencies. Typically, for images of resolution stem:[32\times 32] to stem:[128\times 128], we can keep only the stem:[20\times 20] DFCs associated to low frequencies.

Here is a representation of this idea in 1D :

== Global aspect of the FNO

Classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) use very small kernels (typically stem:[3\times 3]). This operation only has a local effect, and it's the sequence of many convolutions that produces more global effects. 

In addition, CNNs often use max or mean-pooling layers, which process the image on several scales. Max-pooling (respectively mean-pooling) consists in slicing the image into small pieces of size stem:[n\times n], then choosing the pixel with the highest value (respectively the average of the pixels) in each of the small pieces. In most cases, stem:[n=2] is used, which divides the number of pixels by 4.

The FNO, on the other hand, uses a stem:[\hat{W}] frequency kernel and stem:[W=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\hat{W})] has full support. For this reason, the effect is immediately non-local. As a result, we can use less layers and we don't need to use a pooling layer.
